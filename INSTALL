# Install the .NET assemblies

the following files are required in 
`r file.path(tools::R_user_dir("rawrr", which='data'), 'rawrrassembly')`
or in the MONO_PATH

```

The download and install can be done on all platforms using the command:
`r rawrr::installRawfileReaderDLLs()`

The in the package included C# source code that can compile into a rawrr.exe file by calling
`r rawrr:::.buildRawrrExe()`. (is executed when the package is loaded)
