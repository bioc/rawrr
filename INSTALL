If you only require to execute the `rawrr.exe` .Net assemblies, install

```
sudo apt-get install mono-runtime libmono-system-data4.0-cil -y
```

If you want to compile `rawrr.exe` from source, please install the following
packages:

```
sudo apt-get install mono-mcs mono-xbuild
```

## macOS (tested on Catalina/BigSur)

```
brew install mono
```

or install from

https://www.mono-project.com/

## Microsoft Windows

Running the `rawrr.exe` will run out of the box.

If the native C# compiler is not available install mono from:

https://www.mono-project.com/


# Install the .NET assemblies

the following files are required in 
`r tools::R_user_dir("rawrr", which='cache')`
or in the `MONO_PATH`

```
ThermoFisher.CommonCore.Data.dll
ThermoFisher.CommonCore.MassPrecisionEstimator.dll
ThermoFisher.CommonCore.RawFileReader.dll
```

The download and install can be done on all platforms using the command:
`r rawrr::installRawFileReaderDLLs()`

The in the package included C# source code that can compile into a rawrr.exe file by calling
`r rawrr:::buildRawrrExe()`. (is executed when the package is loaded)
